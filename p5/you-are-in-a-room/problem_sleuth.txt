You are one of the top Problem Sleuths in the city. Solicitations for your service are numerous in quantity. Compensation, adequate. It is a balmy summer evening. You are feeling particularly hard boiled tonight. 

What will you do?

Quickly retrieve arms from safe.
You are fed up with being a squishy, necrotic doormat. It is time to use your most potent COMBAT OPERANDI of all!

You quickly transform into ZOMBIE CORSAIR DICK to suit the nautical theme of your awesome marine mammal-based attack.
BUMP
ZIP
You fire your HARPOON GUN into the great monster's hide and hoist yourself up.

In the process you rudely bump PI and knock his aim off kilter a bit.



You make a stand for the freedom of your people. There shall be no Dick trod upon again. The Prophecy was true. You are the Chosen One.

THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED!



The cannon's fire drifts...



BOOM
CRASH
CRASH
CRASH
CRASH
The sperm whale falls through the sky and lands on a building.

This all seems highly, highly improbable.



The impact of the fall finally snuffs out your FLICKER completely. Zombie Ace's GAMBIT SCHEMA has expired.

You have fallen through many floors of a building and landed in a JAIL CELL. There is a friendly looking man in the corner with an odd variety of POSSESSIONS. He is likely completely sane. You look forward to becoming friends with him and working together to escape.

You can't imagine what could possibly go wrong.

AD: Become Punisher Ace Dick.

Your seething vengeance transforms you into a gritty, gun-toting vigilante.

However, due to your abysmal IMAGINATION, this is the best costume you come up with. You draw a ridiculous looking skull on the front of your jacket with a dark stone. Or maybe it was an old lump of dog shit. You're not really sure.

You can't believe how shitty your guns are. It is extraordinarily unlikely that they work at all.

AD+Bathearst: Fight crime.

EMOTIONS
You watch over the flaming ruins of your once great empire. You have nothing left. You are going to make them pay for this.

DMK's EMOTIONS elevate. Nothing upsets him quite like the loss of a profitable empire of white collar crime. It's almost too much for him to bear.

AD: Spin Wheel of Life.

You consult with the WHEEL OF LIFE to guide you on how to proceed with the outrageous ass-kicking that is sure to follow.

However, the wheel narrowly misses the crime fighting slot. It looks like you and your son will be heading WEST instead.

That's LIFE, you guess.



ACE DICK HAS CONTRACTED CASE OF "PROSPECTOR'S COLON".

Press RETURN to size up the situation

          Date: May 5, 
PFPI spots the huge floating TRAFFIC LIGHT PORTALS which everyone seems to have forgotten about. He splits them into two distinct closed circuits.



PFPI approaches the speed of light. (Which unfortunately for the FAN, still remains at its unchanged constant value.)



COMB RAVE
FFPI uses the rest of the honey for the other HALF RAVE MANEUVER: LARGE HADRON ANTI-PART-PICKLE ACCELERATION.



The LARGE HADRON PART-PICKLES draw aim at DMK, just beneath the LARGE HAT, DRAWN on top of his head.



The two PART-PICKLES collide, obliterating each other in an act of self-sacrifice. It is a chance to use their lives for the greater good which they RELISH.



EMOTIONS
Death was unsuccessful in his attempt to shoo everyone back in the door, so they have no choice but to brace for impact.

Ace Dick shields sweet Bathearst from the terrific blast. You won't lose him this time. Never again, you say. Never again.

The tender reunion causes DMK to grow a second EMOTIONS gauge. What are you doing to this poor man??



There is a strange fellow standing on top of the large HAT DRAWN on DMK's head. You're quite sure you've never detected his existence before, and probably never will again.

You have discovered the elusive, super-massive HIGGS BONEHEAD. He appears to be very dense, unintelligent, slow-moving, and tragically, short-lived.



You can probably end this whole thing right now with one clean head(bulb)shot.



The mournful look in Death's empty sockets says it all.

You are not long for this world, Mr. Bonehead. I am so sorry.

Higgs Bonehead: Target weak spot with kamikaze attack.

In a moment of quick thinking, you realize Problem Sleuth will need the scope to reactivate the wheel and turn the universe.

PS plugs the scope into the wheel.



You flip the universe, reversing the Bonehead's course, directly toward the bulb.

But wait, something is happening...



RESOLVE
You are determined not to let this opportunity slip by. You are just way too hard boiled to be deterred by the setback. With decisive action, you issue a command to your shipmate.

PI: Go pick up huge barrel.

SNEAK SNEAK SNEAK

SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP SLAP


You are having a hard time inflicting any damage on DMMK, who is shielded by his strong gravitational field. It seems to be absorbing everything you throw at it, including lashes of paint and scalding flames.



RIPENESS
You examine your SCHEMA PUMPKIN. It is looking awfully pungent. This is unsurprising, since it's almost February and you should have taken it off your porch months ago.

PI's GAMBIT SCHEMA is mere moments from expiring.



The patrons of the speakeasy have put the witching hour to good use. They have imbibed heavily, and any one of these fellas'll tell you the whole wingding's gone like eggs in coffee. Everyone is in agreement it's about time to relocate this hootenanny to the sleazy brothel.

But the HATLESS MAN demands a nightcap before they go. He slurs instructions to the barkeep that he'd like whatever's in that bottle over there.



They head for the studio, but the Madame does not appear to be around. Maybe she's in the dollhouse tending to her ladies?

Patrons: Enter dollhouse.

Gentlemen: Aggress DMMK.

The Mannerly Highbrow bustles on to the stage with a spirited game of HOOP AND STICK. He was but a lad when he last played. The activity has him feeling youthful and invigorated, free as a swollen-breasted popinjay!

Highbrow: LV. 4 HOOPTECH -> DMMK KATAMARI BALL

The ball soon accumulates every character under the dollhouse. The Highbrow unsurprisingly is absorbed by his own ball.

DMMK: Tighten drawstrings.

CRASH
Comb report.

WIPE WIPE
It is the mother of all combs.

The Professor hopes you know what you are doing.

Fan report.

Pickle Inspector isn't faring much better with his blasted FRANKENSTEIN SLOWNESS. He almost seems as slow as the lousy stupid speed of light.



THERE IS NO TIME FOR FRANKENSTEIN SLOWNESS WHICH IS A GOOD TIME FOR FRANKENSTEIN SLOWNESS.

PS: Turn wheel 9

The BARREL bounces off PI's head, sailing overboard laterally.

DMMK descends from the heavens much to the rapture of his zealous acolytes.

They herald the Messianic arrival of their beloved mob boss. They have kept His empire well and He is pleased.

Everyone: Exit Life.

DEATH
POF
Meanwhile in the afterlife, everyone hears a lot of commotion outside the door. Everyone decides to go check it out, with brazen disregard for Death's polite request that they stay put.

Death throws down his hat in disappointment.

He really must remember to invest in stronger security measures for the afterlife.

Everyone: Exit Afterlife.

The VULNERABULB has closed. DMK makes his ominous final as(des)cent.

Hatless Man: Drink Ink of Squid Pro Quo.

SWAT
Hysterical Dame swats the bottle of ink away from the foolish drunkard.

Thugs: Prostrate thyselves before savior.

GRAVITY BRASSIER
MASS ^ 
You have become so frazzled by people coming and going, you completely forgot to have some TEA prepared for your new guests. 

It seems all the imaginary Pickle Inspectors have finally caught up with each other in the afterlife.

Death: Beg visitors to stay.
Bonehead: ? 
You plead with these fellows to stay put in the afterlife. You are at your wit's end. You will do anything.

The gentlemen agree amicably to remain where they are. The gray fellow appears to be way too large and unintelligent to leave anyway.

HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS
The Madame, who appears not to have left with the others, gives her assurance as well. She suggests a round of that game you were so fond of. The one with the mammals. She doesn't mind.

If you didn't know better, you would swear the Madame was beginning to fancy you. You become a little uncomfortable.

PS: Get ye ink flask.
POCKET
Problem Sleuth acquires the INK OF SQUID PRO QUO and puts it safely in his POCKET, where any good flask belongs.

The items remaining in your inventory are, of course, 4 precious pieces of CANDY CORN, a lot of useless AMMUNITION, and your supplies of ELF TEARS, WEASEL SNOT, HOG SLOP, and PIE FILLING, each respectively at 36, 12, and 40.

DMK
It's DMK's third and final face. He is more fearsome than ever, with THREE HEALTH METERS, and a deadly BLACK HOLE VERSION OF HIS NON-IMAGINARY SELF pulsing on top of his HAT.

In addition to which, he is completely invulnerable to all physical attacks, and has no weakness to increases in BLOOD SUGAR or EMOTIONS. He is only susceptible to damage caused by righteous fires of charisma, but it is doubtful there is any hero in the cosmos bold enough to wield them. 

OH. He also regenerates any quantity of damage he suffers instantaneously.

Good luck!

NB+HD:Get sucked into event horizon in more elongated manner

As you approach the EVENT HORIZON, the strong tidal forces cause your ASPECT RATIOS to be stretched out.

NB loosens her ASPECT CORSET to compensate.



The closer you get, the more pronounced the gravitational TIME DILATION becomes. 

To everyone else in the universe, your appear to be slowing down until you seem frozen in time, just outside the horizon.

But to you, everything in the universe appears to be speeding up.



Just before you cross the horizon, you catch a glimpse of every future event in the universe all happening at once.

NB: Put on sunglasses.

What you witness cannot be described by words. A spectacle transcending time and space. If it is true a thousand angels dance on the head of a pin, then so it seems all universal events imagined and real play on the polarized lens of a Hollywood B-list celebrity.



You cross through the EVENT HORIZON.

DMK: LV. 99 CODDLETECH -> THORNSWOGGLE

DMK deploys his black BRIER OF CRUELTY. The macabre thicket acts as yet another impenetrable defensive barrier, as if he needed one. 

DMK can also wield the bramble offensively. The frisky creepers get down to business. It is the business of not minding their own business, and involving themselves in your business.



PS and PI are constricted in a PRICKLY SLEEPER HOLD.

Could this be the end? I suppose if you were to perish, you could always just walk out of Death's door again.

OH WAIT



Death and company: LV. 3 HIPPOTECH: THE HUNGER



Hippo Inspectors: Ascend to Godhead.

The four PIs are beckoned by their Creator. GPI fondly regards his beloved children.



GPI has a specific task for the four of you. Naturally you are all eager to do His divine bidding.

PIs: TEMPORAL REPLICSIMILE AD INFINITUM

PAST ? ? FUTURE   PAST ? ? FUTURE   PAST ? ? FUTURE
Each PI divides himself into two smaller parts, deploying one to the past, the other to the future. 

Their parts continue this process, ad infinitum.

Soon the PART-PICKLES are so small they exist on the atomic scale, and so plentiful, they occupy every location in every moment of the universe's history.

NEUTRINO x7
ELECTRON xenergy interactions have even created some MORONS and MORON NEUTRINOS. Sadly, their lifespans are rather short and they undergo the process of MORON DECAY.



POCKET
The PART-PICKLES spread throughout history to comprise all of the matter in the universe at every moment in time. 

And so it was that GPI created the universe. He regarded His creation with fondness and saw that it was good.



The tidal forces have stretched Hysterical Dame into a string of quarks.

Nervous Broad maintains her voluptuous, full-bodied figure, but isn't sure how much more she can loosen her corset.

HD+NB: Land already.

HD reverts back to her original dimensions.



The others land too.

You wonder where the heck NB went!



It seems you were all standing on her. She tightens her corset.



It looks like the DEMIMONDE GODDESS has been waiting here to greet you, wherever it is 'here' might be.

She had on an earlier occasion summoned her army of COURTESAN ANGELS to help her escape. They naturally proved to be of no use whatsoever.

There are an awful lot of them.




The gravitational pull of BHMK is slowly drawing every heavenly body closer together.

The levels of the CATHEDRAL OF SYNDETIC ASCENSION are telescoping under the forces of compression.



You retrieve the TECTRIX OF THE ARBITOR you were granted as a boon from the Weasel King a while ago to duel with Death. You had since stowed it in your HAT for safekeeping. That bit of cunning foresight was certainly a feather in your cap, figuratively speaking of course.

PI: TICKLETECH -> LV. 
PS: CATCH IT!!!

INK
DMK


With everyone distracted by the spectacle overhead, you think now would be a good time to lodge a CONTRABASS CLARINET between the DOORS OF LIFE AND DEATH. You're tired of letting so many wayfaring souls slip through your bony fingers.



Due to principles of uncertainty regarding the existence of angels in a vacuum, each splits in to ANGEL/ANTIANGEL PAIRS.

For each pair, one of the two escapes, while the other falls back into the black hole.



The black hole emits SATANGELIC HAWKING RADIATION, and shrinks due to loss of mass/energy.

DS: SERAPHIMIC DYNAMEIS -> CHERUBUM'S RUSH

The angels and antiangels that remained in the black hole settle back down on the HAT.

Hatless man: Retrieve HAT.

FLURBB..
The man vomits into his HAT.

DS: Grant PS a boon.

She plucks a RIBBON from her hair and supplies you with ammunition. 

You acquire one INK RIBBON CARTRIDGE.

PS: Load weapon.

RATTLE TATTA TAP TAP DING
You hammer at the KEYS of the SMITH CORONA. The machine gun fire of your typing roars throughout the heavens.

You pen a strongly worded, rather UNPLEASANT NOTE to DMK.



SICK BURN
DMK's SICK BURN meter suffers a critical spike.



In a last ditch effort to salvage diplomatic proceedings, you invoke the ultimate resolution in your formal attache of plenipotentiary clauses, motioning for bilateral demilitarization and cessation of hostilities for the mutual advancement and prolonged commitment to the furtherance of harmonious relations among sovereign parties.

MSPA readers: Never mind. Continue.

DMK
Devil: Prod damned with FORK.

The universe is becoming a rather crowded place.



You take the CHRONOSCOPE from the WHEEL again, and attach it to your trusty SEXTANT.



Through careful adjustment of the instrument's various mirrors and dials, you rotate the entire universe about the ship's vertical axis.

The ship casts off from DMK, who wants no part of that blazing sun. You are free to navigate the stars... for however long they might last.



You already did that a while ago!

And it was a lot of fun. 

But the time for such games has passed. MT. ST. LARDASS is in a critical state of instability. Your kingdom is in jeopardy.



You direct your IMPERIAL GAZING WAND above. What you spy through the EYEPEEP troubles you deeply. It is not just your kingdom, but the whole universe which is in peril. 

You regally ponder the fuck out over the dilemma. You know the answer lies within the depths of your bottomless kingly wisdom.

You know there is only one hope. There is only one CHOSEN ARBITOR.

Weasel King: Commune with arbitor.

The souls of the ARBITOR and the KING merge as one. The prophecy was true. Destiny flips the fuck out.

PS: FINAL FLIP OUT

DING DING


INK
The rest of your INK is drained, fueling a final conflagration of all-consuming holy charisma.







The majesty of your personal charm spreads throughout the cosmos. Legend will speak of a great CHAMPION OF PULCHRITUDE. Scribes will scrawl His praises. Bards will wail His glories. Poets will bleed their inkwells dry and weep them full again. Men of character will breathe this story their passion; as warrior blows white conk on jagged rock; as paramour puts flushed lip to lover's mouth. Men of spirit aflame, open of shirt and snug of pantaloon; rose-breasted men with swiveling hips, nimble legs and restless hearts; men whose vehemence of temperament fills their throats with melody, their footwork with rhythm. The fiery cluck of learned, genteel men as these will pique the ear with tales of this Champion.

A Champion, who by mettle of His glowing personal charm alone, saved the universe.



DMK


The VULNERABULB blooms, exposing DMK's FETAL SEEDPOD. If it is allowed to detach, it will mature into a new and revitalized DMK.

You probably should not let this happen!



Unfortunately SEPULCHRITUDE has sapped your last ounce of VIM. 

There isn't even a large object around to throw at it anyway!

Meanwhile, that useless skipper of yours is off gallivanting somewhere.



The useless skipper makes note of the development with his keen ogle.

No time to correct the ship's course! You'll have to refit SNIPER RIFLE with the scope for a final killshot.

Hurry you fool!



FUMBLE
This is incredibly urgent!

BHMK: Tighten drawstrings to limit.

GRAVITY BRASSIER
MASS * anti-angels to finish off the foul demonhead. They swarm to your command.

DMK: DEFENSIVE GLOWER

DEFEND THE SEEDPOD AT ALL COSTS! BACK YE WENCHES!!!



The Demimonde Semigoddess has been slain.

PI: Flip wheel one last time.

You turn the universe, redirecting the bust toward the underside of the black hole.



CAPTAIN SNOOP is pulled in.



The angelic army has been all but exterminated. A preoccupied DMK does not notice the trojan bust advancing.



The bust explodes on impact. The candy inside rains sugary death on the FETAL SEEDPOD.

MOUNT SAINT LARDASS erupts.



The black hole explodes.



The universe reverts to its prior dimensions.



Everyone and everything trapped in the black hole is ejected in random directions throughout the universe.



DMK'S HAT falls through the sky.



You breathe a sigh of relief. You can't imagine what you could possibly be forgetting to do.

What the heck is that giant ticking sound?



And what is the meaning of this large, busty fishwoman in your wheel's viewport?



Oh dear.







The bust to the face sends you reeling.







DMK'S HAT is skewered by the HAM NEEDLE.

PS+AD+PI: Land in a hard boiled manner.

RING RING
Another balmy summer evening. The city rolls these nights like loaded dice. 

It's tough for a flatfoot to make it in a town like this. Some towns are built loose and a stiff breeze of upset blows through, but these bricks are tight-knit. Built like a damn Chippewa birchbark canoe. Not much daylight seeps through, see? A gumshoe asks questions and questions upset. It's like some shawlless dame frostbit in winter, too proud to take your coat for some damn reason. You know how dames are. The city turns her cold shoulder to a type a fella and that's all there is to it.

But a steak dinner don't pay for itself if you catch my drift.

The streets won't bang on your office glass and ask for placation. The streets ease themselves, but a type of fella knows better than to just step aside. A man finds space between the city's greased wheels of upkeep and when the time spins along it sees, yeah, it sees there were feet filling shoes on just that slab of rock. A man waits and listens. Every place, a placation. The alleyway spike of a bottle breaking - some tipsy beggar tithes to gravity, razor jewels shimmering on oilslick asphalt. The wail of a baby three floors up - ink is blotted before pact of appeasement sealed, hot formula dabbed on mother's wrist. And the shrill complaint of a phone... 

Ain't no one can say a man wasn't filling shoes here.

Answer phone.

You pick up the phone and to no surprise it is some dame yacking about something.

It's always the same with dames. Always roped in a fix to some john with busy meat hooks and a spell of bad habits. Makes a man reach for his flask just thinkin' about it.

Miss, if you'll just settle down I'll...

Toots, listen. I can barely understand a word you're...

Sweatheart, I can't make heads or tails of...

Hang up.

CLICK
The woman was clearly hysterical. 

It doesn't matter what she had to say though. A hard boiled lug like you has seen enough weepy lamps and spoiled makeup jobs to know what the matter is. What the matter is there's a problem. And you'll be damned if you aren't gonna be the fellas to sleuth it.

There's only one thing left to do now.

Pose as a team. The world is real.
